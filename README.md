# Valve Timing Calculator

The Valve Timing Calculator is a Java-based application designed to help mechanics, engineers, and automotive enthusiasts calculate and visualize the valve timing events of internal combustion engines. This tool allows users to input various parameters like intake and exhaust durations, lobe separation, and valve timing advance, and computes the opening and closing timings for both intake and exhaust valves.

## Features

- Graphical user interface for easy parameter entry
- Calculation of valve opening and closing events
- Display of valve timing overlap
- Customizable for different engine configurations
